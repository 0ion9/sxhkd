    HOTKEY
        COMMAND

    HOTKEY := CHORD_1 ; CHORD_2 ; ... ; CHORD_n
    CHORD_i := [MODIFIER_i][@|!|:]KEYSYM_i
    MODIFIER_i := MODIFIER_i1 + MODIFIER_i2 + ... + MODIFIER_ik

.PP
The valid modifier names are:
.BR super , " hyper", " meta", " alt", " control", " ctrl", " shift", " mode_switch", " lock", " mod1", " mod2", " mod3", " mod4" ", and" " mod5" .
.PP
The keysym names are given by the output of
.BR xev (1).
.PP
Hotkeys and commands can be spread across multiple lines by ending each partial line with a backslash character.
.PP
When multiple chords are separated by semicolons, the hotkey is a chord chain: the command will only by executed after receiving each chord of the chain in consecutive order.
.PP
If
.I @
is added at the beginning of the keysym, the command will be run on key release events, otherwise on key press events.
.PP
If
.I !
is added at the beginning of the keysym, the command will be run on motion notify events and must contain two integer conversion specifications which will be replaced by the
.BR x " and " y
coordinates of the pointer relative to the root window referential (the only valid button keysyms for this type of hotkeys are:
.BR button1 ",..., " button5 ).
.PP
If
.I :
is added at the beginning of the keysym, the captured event will be replayed for the other clients.
.PP
Mouse hotkeys can be defined by using one of the following special keysym names:
.BR button1 ", " button2 ", " button3 ", ..., " button24 .
.PP
The hotkey and the command may contain a sequence of the form
.IR {STRING_1,...,STRING_N} .
.PP
In addition, the sequences can contain ranges of the form
.IB A - Z
where
.IR A " and " Z
are alphanumeric characters.
.PP
What is actually executed is
.IB SHELL " -c "
.IR COMMAND ,
which means you can use environment variables in
.IR COMMAND .
.PP
.I SHELL
will be the content of the first defined environment variable in the following list:
.BR SXHKD_SHELL ", " SHELL .
.PP
If
.B sxhkd
receives a
.I SIGUSR1
signal, it will reload its configuration file.
.PP
If no configuration file is specified through the
.B -c
option, the following is used:
.IR $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sxhkd/sxhkdrc .
